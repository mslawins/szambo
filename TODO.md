## TODO

1. Create compare-all command to allow for comparing all files in directory at once
2. Change compare commands to display value under key in output
3. Allow to add multiple keys into single lang file at once

```
    {
        "foo.hi": "hello",
        "bar.bye": "goodbye"
    }
```

4. Create compare-all command version for pipelines
5. Figure out a way to detect unused translations
